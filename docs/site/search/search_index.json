Cmake is complex and difficult for beginners to use. So I wrapped Cmake once more to make it easier to use as Rust Cargo. Because I created it with reference to Cargo, the general configuration file is similar to Cargo.toml. Cppm works only with Cmake, so you can build with Cmake. Cppkg is the dependency manager for Cppm. Since cppkg uses Cmake's Exteranl_Porject_Add , it supports cross-platfrom install. Cppm supports Hunter Package manager. So cppm dependency can be either hunter or cppkg.
